A refactor of the MEAN CMS project. This is a work in progress that currently allows an existing Admin to login and perform CRUD operations on the site content (a set of pages visible to the public).

NOTE: MongoDB must already be configured locally AND at least one user must exist in the database with a username and password to login.

Path to login as Admin
/admin/login

View pages admin dash (Note: pages cannot be updated or deleted if not signed in)
/admin/pages
